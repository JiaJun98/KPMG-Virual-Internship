# KPMG-Virual-Internship
This repository consists of 3 tasks from the virtual internship. 
All datasets are properties of Forage pte ltd and they reserve the final rights.

## 1.Data Quality Assessment

In this task, I act as a junior data analyst in KPMG's Lighthouse and Innvation Team. I have coordinated with Sprocket Central Pty Ltd , a medium size bikes & cycling accessories organisation. Sprocket Central Pty Ltd requires help for its customer and transactions data.The organisation has a large dataset relating to its customers, but their team is unsure how to effectively analyse it to help optimise its marketing strategy. 

In the spreadsheet provided, there are 3 datasets:
 * Customer Demographic 
 * Customer Addresses
 * Transactions data in the past 3 months
    

## 2. Data Insights 

After cleaning and assessing the quality of the data, I developed a predictive model using “TensorFlow” and “Keras” to predict high-value customers from relationships established between customer demographics and transactions via feature engineering

## 3.Data Insights and Presentations

In the last task, after performing customer profiling in the dataset, I built an interactive Tableau dashboard highlighting key trends in datasets on customer preferences and propensity to the client and propose growth strategies to improve customer targeting


1. First ordered list item
2. Another item
  * Unordered sub-list. 
1. Actual numbers don't matter, just that it's a number
  1. Ordered sub-list
4. And another item.

   You can have properly indented paragraphs within list items. Notice the blank line above, and the leading spaces (at least one, but we'll use three here to also align the raw Markdown).

   To have a line break without a paragraph, you will need to use two trailing spaces.⋅⋅
   Note that this line is separate, but within the same paragraph.⋅⋅
   (This is contrary to the typical GFM line break behaviour, where trailing spaces are not required.)

* Unordered list can use asterisks
- Or minuses
+ Or pluses
