# KPMG-Virual-Internship
This repository consists of 3 tasks from the virtual internship. 
All datasets are properties of Forage pte ltd and they reserve the final rights.

#1.Data Quality Assessment

In this task, I have recommended a suitable marketing strategy to a bike and cycling accessories company improving funnel conversion rate in the new Australian market via EDA optimizing data quality of customer demographics and transactions.

#2. Data Insights 

After cleaning and assessing the quality of the data, I developed a predictive model using “TensorFlow” and “Keras” to predict high-value customers from relationships established between customer demographics and transactions via feature engineering

#3.Data Insights and Presentations

In the last task, after performing customer profiling in the dataset, I built an interactive Tableau dashboard highlighting key trends in datasets on customer preferences and propensity to the client and propose growth strategies to improve customer targeting
