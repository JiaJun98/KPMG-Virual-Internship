# KPMG-Virual-Internship
This repository consists of 3 tasks from the virtual internship. 
All datasets are properties of Forage pte ltd and they reserve the final rights.

## 1.Data Quality Assessment

In this task, I act as a junior data analyst in KPMG's Lighthouse and Innvation Team. I have coordinated with Sprocket Central Pty Ltd , a medium size bikes & cycling accessories organisation. Sprocket Central Pty Ltd requires help for its customer and transactions data.The organisation has a large dataset relating to its customers, but their team is unsure how to effectively analyse it to help optimise its marketing strategy. 

In the spreadsheet provided, there are 3 datasets:
 * Customer Demographic 
 * Customer Addresses
 * Transactions data in the past 3 months
    

## 2. Data Insights 

After cleaning and assessing the quality of the data, I developed a predictive model using “TensorFlow” and “Keras” to predict high-value customers from relationships established between customer demographics and transactions via feature engineering

## 3.Data Insights and Presentations

In the last task, after performing customer profiling in the dataset, I built an interactive Tableau dashboard highlighting key trends in datasets on customer preferences and propensity to the client and propose growth strategies to improve customer targeting
